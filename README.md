NSABlocklistÂ© file original created under the MITM license 2015 by CHEF-KOCH.

Description:
------------
This isn't yet another [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) or [DNSBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL) that claims to secure the web, it's specially designed to _stop_ known NSA / GCHQ servers from beeing connect to you. It's not designed to block malware, spyware or anything that is already avaible on the net. This hosts or the super ranges lists could block some of your sites/servers you may need, so you'll be warned!


This project includes
------------
* An '[HOSTS.txt](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/HOSTS.txt)' file that includes all Servers/DNS that are known as NSA or GCHQ involved.
* An separate 'Super Ranges' file that includes a list of known IP ranges that are possible compromised (be careful with that!).
* An '[LICENSE](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/LICENSE)' File to shows the MITM license.
* The '[README](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/README.md)' (this) file that includes the latest news, updates and explanations,...
* An '[problematic.txt](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/problematic.txt)' file wich includes DNS/PTRs that are possible problematic for you. 


Important Notice
------------
* A true list of compromised IPs would list the entire Internet, then on to the fuller range open mouth blabbering of blogs, email, chat rooms, texting, aided and abetted by the world's telecoms, postal services, and, most reliably, bedroom  murmurings.
* I do not accept donations, I'm not doing this because I want $$money or hype I'm doing this because I didn't found a proper list on the whole internet and of course I want to share my knowledge for free. I always think that such information should be available for everyone on the world.


Do you hate the NSA or other agencies?
------------
* I do not _hate_ the NSA or other agencies but I really don't like that everyone is automatically under the microscope and of course that there is no opt-out or transparency excpect lies and more lies (and some excuses ...yeah, we are doing this because terrorism, go f$ck yourself with such statements!)
* Everyone have something to hide, passwords, privat data, accounts, ....


Known problems hosts file can't fix
------------
* An hosts file is no guarantee, if the NSA is already in your system it's already to late.
* HOSTS files are no guarantee that the NSA or any other attacker/organization could simply bypass it via 0day or other vulnerabilitys on your system/router.
* HOSTS files can't protect against attacks directly on/in the hardware, e.g. if the router is already compromised or comes with backdoors this list will be easily bypassed anyway.
* Due the complex of the entire file I can't explain every single IP or PTR record.
* The hosts file may present an attack vector for malicious software because the file could be modified to redirect the entire traffic e.g. adware or trojans can do this. Ensure that the file was marked as read-only and you're not logged in as adminstrator. 


ToDo:
------------

- [ ] Fix Readme.md, typos, grammar,...
  - [ ] Maybe sort the hosts list alphabetically
  - [ ] Maybe add an seperate hosts file for MS, Apple, Google (if someone ask for it) 
  - [ ] Maybe monthly updates?
- [ ] Find invalid entries or domains that aren't online anymore (high-prio)
- [ ] Fix/merge all reported [issues](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/issues)
    - [ ] Add explanation how to identify compromised domains/DNS
	- [ ] May add solutions example to e.g. secure DNS via DNSCrypt or other solutions
