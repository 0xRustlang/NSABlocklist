An HOSTS file to block NSA spying!


Description:
This isn't yet another hosts file that claims to secure the web, it's specially designed to 'kill' known NSA servers. It's not designed to block malware, spyware or anything that is already avaible on the net. This hosts or the super ranges lists could block some of your sites/servers you may need, so you'll be warned!

The lists is from 2007 with some modifications, like duplicates was removed, ...


What this project includes?
Basically the following stuff:
* An HOSTS file that includes all Servers/DNS that are known as NSA involved.
* An seperate 'Super Ranges' file that includes a list of known IP ranges that are possible compromised (be careful with that!).
* An 'LICENSE' File to show the MITM license.
* The 'README' file that includes the latest news and updates, explanations,...


* A true list of compromised IPs would list the whole Internet, then on to the fuller range open mouth blabbering of blogs, email, chat rooms, texting, aided and abetted by the world's telecoms, postal services, and, most reliably, bedroom  murmurings.
* I hope I can update the list montly, feel free to open an issue ticket and report if you found more servers/IPs.
* I do not accept donations, I'm not doing this because I want money or hype I'm doing this because I didn't found a proper list on the net and because I want to share my knowlage for free with the world. I always think that such information shuld be avaible for everyone on the world. 
* I do not 'hate' the NSA but I hate that everyone is automatically under the microscope and of course that there is no opt-out or transparancy excpect lies and more lies (and some excuses ...yeah, we are doding this because terrorism, go f$ck yourself with that!)



Known problems that a hosts file can't fix:
* An HOSTS file is no guarntee, if the NSA is already in your system it's already to late.
* HOSTS files are no guarntee that the NSA or any other attacker/organisation could simply bypass it via 0day or other vulnerablitlys on your system/router.
* HOSTS files can't protect against attacks on the hardware, if the router is already compromised or comes with backdoors this list will be easily bypassed anyway.
* ....
